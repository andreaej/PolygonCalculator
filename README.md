# More on Inheritance

## Instructions
- You will write a program that extends the Polygon class (provided in Moodle) with the following details
   - class Polygon 
   - attributes:
      - **no new attributes**
  

   - 3 subclasses:
      - appropriate methods for finding the area and perimeter
      - str method: prints properties of the polygon subclass
      
You should create an instances of your subclasses and print the details using your str class method.
